This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

$$\rho(\pi_{\Theta},a_j) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\Theta}} \left[ L(\theta,a_j\right] = \sum_{i}L(\theta_i,a_j)\pi_{\Theta}(\theta_i)$$

$$\rho(\pi_{\Theta},a_j) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_{\Theta}} \left[ L(\theta,a_j\right] = \sum_{i}L(\theta_i,a_j)\pi_{\Theta}(\theta_i) \notag$$


<p>
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
   (x+1)^2 &= (x+1)(x+1)\\
           &= x^2 + 2x + 1
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Let's see if subequation works.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
& 5 + 5\\
& 3 + 4 = 2
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
It does not.

But align works.
\begin{align}
& 5 + 5\\
& 3 + 4 = 2
\end{align}
It does not.
